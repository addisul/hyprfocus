#        <div align = center>                               【Hyprfocus】

Hyprfocus is my personal configuration  of [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland), a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor. This config focuses on speed, minimalism, and usability with dynamic workspaces and essential tools for productivity.
